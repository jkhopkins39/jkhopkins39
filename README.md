## Hi, I'm Jeremy!

- I am a computer science major attending **KSU** (Kennesaw State University).
- I have a particular focus in AI, so I like to learn about the breadth of AI algorithms that exist.
- I love video games and computers, so my repositories are random.
- I use Github as a host for school and personal projects alike.
- Feel free to contact me _@jeremyyhop@gmail.com_ with ideas and projects I should check out!
